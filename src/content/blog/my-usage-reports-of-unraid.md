unRAID is a home NAS system, and it's also my first time using a NAS. Because some friends are using it, I didn't consider other NAS systems. It has been running stably for many years with an excellent user experience, so I'm recording this to share with others.

# Table of Contents

# Usage of File Sharing Function

- Gigabit SMB network drive in the local network, almost all digital devices support it natively.
  - Can be accessed remotely with OpenVPN.
  - Installing a WebDAV can enable HTTP access. _Important data should not be exposed to the public network_
  - For example, in Mac OS Finder:
    - In the same local area network, you will receive broadcasts, and you can find it directly in the sidebar.
    - If you can't find it or are accessing it via VPN from outside, click "Go > Connect to Server", enter the URL according to the protocol, and you can find it in the sidebar.
- Built-in parity check, any hard drive can be directly replaced and recovered with a new one. Greatly improves fault tolerance.
- Regular backup to xx network cloud disk / OSS with RClone.
- Built-in permission management.
- Can be used as a Time Machine backup disk for Mac, wireless backup throughout, automatic backup for seamless experience.
- Storage for surveillance camera footage.

# Plug-ins

## Community Applications

Equivalent to the App Store

## Recycle Bin

Recycle Bin, Wastebasket (only works if file sharing protocol is used)

## Unassigned Devices [plus]

Unassigned devices outside the array, such as USB flash drives, removable drives, etc.

## Compose Manager

Adds docker-compose and a management panel to unRAID. Not being able to customize the icon is annoying.

## USB Manager

Allows easy management of USB devices, which can be assigned directly to VMs. Light use is easier than hardware passthrough.

## User Scripts

Timed tasks. I don't use crontab for two reasons:

1. all configurations, scripts are within Flash backup. (crontab can also be restored as a file `crontab ~/.crontab`)
2. simple visual management.
   Some complex cron doesn't work, so weigh it yourself.

## NerdTools

Package manager. Currently vim, zsh, and nodejs are installed.

## Dynamix File Manager

A file manager embedded directly in the unraid backend admin page, which is somewhat useful, but not much.

## RClone

Web disk synchronization tool, mainly used to compensate for the missing offsite disaster recovery feature, refer to [another article](./offsite-disaster-recovery-for-unraid-with-rclone)

## [WireGuard](https://unraid.net/blog/wireguard-on-unraid) (unRAID built-in)

For details, check out: [[Program Comparison] How to connect to home intranet from outside?] (https://github.com/bowencool/blog/issues/26)

# Virtual Machines

## Soft routing OpenWrt

For this step, you need to buy the NIC hardware and pass it through to the VM, refer to the tutorial on Site B Spoto.

1. DDNS: Used to automatically resolve domain names to the correct public IP, because the public IP of telecom broadband changes every now and then, and fixed public IP is too expensive.
2. OpenClash + MosDNS: Special demand on the Chinese network.
3. Other plugins I haven't had the energy, or the need to look into for a while, such as adblocking and traffic control.

## OpenVPN

For details, check out [this article](./how-to-connect-to-the-home-intranet-from-outside)

Since the docker version is no longer maintained, it's loaded into a virtual machine.

## ~~Windows 10~~

I am already an Apple ecosystem user, ~~so I need a virtual machine to run some Windows-exclusive software.~~

~~I have switched to using Parallels Desktop to simulate the Windows environment.~~

I built a PC for gaming, hahaha.

# Docker

## MySql & Redis

Infrastructure.

## Nginx

> has been moved to a virtual machine to facilitate automatic certificate renewal.

It is used to

1. Assign the domain name instead of [IP:Port]
2. Unify the handling of https
   1. certificate applied with Certbot, official website wrote need 80 port open, I was misled for a long time, used self-signed certificate for a long time. [do not need 80, 443 port, with DNS application can be](https://www.cnblogs.com/ellisonzhang/p/14298492.html).
   2. auto-renewal: mainly use [SDK](https://next.api.aliyun.com/api-tools/sdk/Alidns?version=2015-01-09) to add/modify a TXT record to the DNS resolution. AliCloud's API documentation is [here](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/29745.html) , about two or three hours development is completed, [code here](https://gist.github.com/bowencool/ d0bce4bfb853c7ec1b1a4964e9371381).

## Tailscale

For more information, see [this article](./how-to-connect-to-the-home-intranet-from-outside).

## ~~NextCloud~~

It can be understood as a privately deployed AWS S3 or Google Drive.

It has a lot of features and a rich ecosystem, not just cloud storage.

There are quite a few minor issues, so I uninstalled it due to my perfectionism.

## MtPhotos

Photo management service, amazing, with functions similar to Apple's photo album, you can also try [Immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich)

- Map albums, scene recognition, face recognition, text recognition...

- **Local recognition supported, with PC hardware acceleration**

- Search images by text, for example: search for "lake"

- Complete client functionality

- Support existing folders and sync to local using iCloudPD for management with MtPhotos. (The benefit is seamless automatic backup without needing to open any app)

- Multi-user support

Outperforms all Chinese cloud storage services **(1. privacy and censorship issues; 2. may lose Exif information)**, NextCloud, PhotoPrisma (inhuman operation and no multi-user support), Pho, Xiaomi Album.

## Gitea

Lightweight git service, Gitlab is too heavy. The tool chain (GitLens, Alfred, third-party clients, etc.) is also relatively complete.

## Bitwarden

Cross-platform password management tool that covers mainstream browsers, Android, iOS, Mac, and supports command line and Alfred. It can also store bank cards, address forms, etc.

Chrome and iCloud are good but not cross-platform.

> 2022-08-15: Today I read a post. Everyone take a look: [chrome passwords leaked out; just realized using chrome to save passwords is like running naked](https://www.v2ex.com/t/872745)

1Password is the ceiling of password management services but passwords are very private data; you need to weigh it yourself.

EnPass can be privately deployed but its functionality is too rudimentary.

My principles for using passwords are:

1. Enable two-factor authentication on all platforms that support it; it's much safer than just using a password.

2. **Do not keep two-factor authentication codes with your passwords**; don't put all your eggs in one basket.

3. Two-factor authentication QR codes (keys) and recovery codes are very important; keep at least one or more copies in the most secure place possible. (I lost an Alibaba Cloud key before and still haven't been able to recover the account even after appealing for help; had to create a new one.)

Tips: Authenticator on a smartwatch works well as you don't have to find your phone. ~~Microsoft's Authenticator supports iCloud sync~~ Salesforce's Authenticator supports viewing on Apple Watch. After trying them all out, I highly recommend 2FAS Auth which has recently gone open source â€“ only thing missing now is Apple Watch support being released soon!

## Home Assistant

A smart home control center that can connect different brands of smart home devices together. For example, you can use Siri to control Xiaomi's lights. **The experience is not as good as Mi Home**.

## Syncthing

Used to synchronize software configurations, with a focus on Alfred and iTerm2 configurations. Previously used NextCloud for synchronization, but NextCloud often had problems so I switched.

The difference between synchronization and mounting is that mounting refers to remote files, which disappear when the connection is disconnected. Synchronization, on the other hand, means keeping your local and remote files consistent, with no significant impact if the connection is disconnected.

The difference between Syncthing and rclone is that Syncthing is a real-time, distributed background process, while rclone is command-based and primarily used for one-way synchronization (bidirectional sync is still in the beta stage). It's similar to rsync and mainly used for cloud storage synchronization.

I have replaced Syncthing with rclone (crontab) + webdav for the following reasons:

1. Syncthing's ignore syntax is too non-mainstream, and it seems that its ignored file do not sync between devices.

2. After restored from Time Machine, Syncthing actually requires manual resetting of ID before it can be used again; truly troublesome.

## [WebDAV](https://hub.docker.com/r/bytemark/webdav)

If you have installed Nextcloud or Alist, then you don't need to install this.

Similar to SMB, WebDAV uses the HTTP protocol. Some third-party clients support WebDAV synchronization (mostly Chrome extensions), so I installed it for that purpose.

## [aliyundrive-webdav](https://hub.docker.com/r/messense/aliyundrive-webdav)

If you have installed Alist, then you don't need to install this.

This is an implementation of webDAV for Aliyun Drive mainly used for backup purposes. There are some caching issues but they are not significant.

## AList

A web-based file browser with many features such as support for cloud storage, synchronization, and downloads.

It can use its built-in webdav feature to compensate for rclone's lack of support for certain types of cloud storage like Quark Cloud.

It can be used instead of Nginx(autoindex) to host the Public folder in order to share files with friends.

I tried it out and I'm not very trusting of its permissions handling.

## [OpenLDAP](https://hub.docker.com/r/osixia/openldap/) + [phpldapadmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/osixia/phpldapadmin/)

Unified authentication. With so many applications installed, changing passwords is too cumbersome.

Tried FreeIPA, but encountered an error that couldn't be resolved, so I gave up.

Currently integrated with OpenVPN and Gitea.

## ~~Transmission~~

A downloader that hasn't been used for a long time.

## ~~[xware](https://hub.docker.com/r/caiguai/docker-xware)~~

Remote download tool for Thunder. Installed but not used.

## Aria2

By the end of 2022, I switched to using [Aria2-Pro](https://p3terx.com/archives/docker-aria2-pro.html) + [AriaNg](https://p3terx.com/archives/aria2-frontend-ariang-tutorial.html) / [Aria2 Explorer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mpkodccbngfoacfalldjimigbofkhgjn) as a full protocol downloader.

## Jellyfin

Home theater service. My little integrated graphics are struggling a bit. It's a bit redundant for ordinary people, not as convenient as screen casting.

## ~~[QingLong](https://hub.docker.com/r/whyour/qinglong)~~

It is also a scheduled task, mainly used to automatically perform tasks on JD.com.

After using it for a while, hundreds of Jingdong beans were credited to my account every day, which was quite great. (2023.04: Can't get much profit anymore)

Although it may not be enough to be convicted of damaging computer systems, being banned is still very likely, so I stopped using it.

## ~~Wiznote~~ / ~~Joplin~~

In the end, I decided to use IDE + Git instead of these note-taking software. I think no matter how well note-taking software is done, it will always be inferior to IDE. IDE can have unlimited possibilities with plugins and can conform to your writing habits.

## RSSHub + FreshRSS

I'm relying more and more on RSS, it's very efficient.

For the client, use Reeder (paid) or NetNewsWire (open source free) for Mac / iOS, and Feedme for Android. It's great to have cross-platform synchronization.

## ~~[DeepL Free API](https://hub.docker.com/r/zu1k/deepl)~~ [DeepLX](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX)

Used for [Bob](https://bobtranslate.com/) and [Immersive Translate](https://immersivetranslate.com/).

# Next Step Plan

Here is the feature I want to implement next. If you have any recommended or updated feature, feel free to share.

## Deprecated Optical Modem

Recently changed the optical modem (new telecom optical modems are all like this), and then encountered a problem: the domain name is resolved to the optical modem, normal access from the public network, but cannot be accessed from the internal network. It was fine before, and I couldn't find the reason. I suspect that the optical modem intercepted it. Currently, manually modifying host records in OpenWrt can barely work. If anyone knows about this, please leave a message. I want to buy an optical-to-electric module directly plugged into NAS, but it seems unnecessary.

Advantages:

1. Solve this loopback access problem

2. Slightly increase bandwidth, estimated at 5%~10%

3. No need for port forwarding anymore

## Research ZFS

Unraid 6.12 already supports it.

## Encrypted backup

Duplicacy / Duplicati

# Update December 2022

## OpenWrt has enabled IPv6

[Refer to this article](https://www.lategege.com/?p=676), the reason is that the living environment is using china mobile broadband, and there is currently no public IP.

Advantages:

1. No need for port forwarding, can directly resolve to Nginx.
2. ~~Can use ports 443 and 80 (not sure, but I encountered problems after only a few weeks)~~.

Disadvantages:

1. IPv6 is not widely used; if a company's network does not enable IPv6, then it's helpless.
2. By default all devices are exposed to the extranet, which undoubtedly increases the security risk.
3. Some telecommunications companies (such as Anhui Mobile) have unstable resolution of IPv6.
4. Debugging is complex with many pitfalls; I experienced two less obvious pitfalls:
   1. Remember to enable MSS clamping in the firewall on OpenWrt.
   2. The old optical modem may cause stuttering; you can directly request the telecommunications company to replace it with a new one at home

## Accessing Intranet Services via IPv6

Final form: DDNS (IPv6) directly points to Nginx, which then forwards to the intranet IPv4 service (Docker container). I now have a public IPv4 address again, with dual-stack resolution.

You can take a look at [this post](https://www.v2ex.com/t/488116) and the links mentioned within.
