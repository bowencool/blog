## Hi there 👋, I'm Bowen

- 🦄 I am a Full-Stack Engineer with a strong focus on Front-End development.
- 😂 I am a person who has been laid off 3 times but still loves programming.
- 💻 My programing language: JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Dart.
- 🔭 I am currently searching for job opportunities, preferring to work remotely or start a business.
- 🙅‍♂️ I would not consider any job that requires "996" unless the pay is very high.
- 📫 You can contact me through the following email addresses:
  - root@bowen.cool for technical communications.
  - biz@bowen.cool for business or job-related matters.
